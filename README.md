The Galician-TreeGal is a treebank for Galician language labeled using Universal Dependencies, developed between January and July, 2016, at LyS Group (Universidade da Coruña).

The resource derives from a subset (called *xeral*) of the XIADA corpus (v2.6), created at the Centro Ramón Piñeiro para a Investigación en Humanidades (http://corpus.cirp.es/xiada/).

All the information except the syntactic one was semi-automatically converted to UD from the original resource. The dependency labels were assigned using cross-lingual parsing techniques, and then manually corrected by a linguist (see the references for more information).

### Stats
Tree count:  1000
Word count:  24219
Token count: 24219
Dep. relations: 35 of which 0 language specific
POS tags: 15
Category=value feature pairs: 43

### Issues
* The tokenization of compound nouns and of some multiword expressions has few disagreements regarding UD.
* The dependency labels need to be reviewed by another expert to calculate inter-annotator agreement.
